# Deep_Learning_For_Computer_Vision

--------

There are 4 metrics in classification problem, which is super
vised learning.
1. Accuracy
2. prescision
3. recall
4. f1score
5. confusion matrix.

------

Deep Learning:

**Perceptron Model**:

Inputs multiply by random weights, added a bias to avoid zero multiplication 
result, then activation function and then the output.

----

Activation Functions:
1. Simple activation has output 0 for -ve and 1 for +ve.
2. sigmoid output between 0 and 1
3. tanh(x) output between -1 and 1
4. Relu return max(0,x)

-----

Cost Function:
**Quadratic Cost:**

c = E(y-a)^2 / n
it slow down in our learning speed

-----

**Cross Entropy:**

This is for faster learning.
The faster the learning rate as the difference between true value and prediction.

----

Gradient Descent and Back Propagation:

**Gradient descent** use to minimize the value of cost function.
**Back propagation** calculate error contribution  at each neuron after batch of data is 
processed.Its a methametical chain rule.It requires a known desired 
output of each input value.

-----

**YOLO V3** is trained model on COCO dataset of Microsoft, it has 80 different Classes [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)

Audience:
